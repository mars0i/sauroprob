;; There are two kinds of plots supported below.
;;
;; One kind of plot is simply a plot of a function in the normal sense, but
;; you can lot the original logistic function, or n compositions of it with itself.
;;
;; The other kind of plot gives a "path" starting from an initial value
;; through iterations of the function on the value, the result of
;; application of that function, another application, etc. This is one
;; by showing a line from x at y=0 up to f(x), then right or left to y=x
;; [so that the x value there is the same as the old f(x)], and then 
;; up, or down, to the f curve [since that shows how x=f(x) is mapped
;; by f to f(f(x))], and so on.

  "Loops through the values in sequence xs, looking for the first value

  keys :value for the number that cycles, :period for the period of the
  cycle, and :starts-at for the zero-based index of the value that
  starts the cycle. Note that the test for recurrence uses a clojure
  map, which uses the function 'hash' to determine identity.  This means
  that numbers that appear to be equal but that are of different numeric
  data types may or may not be treated as identical.  The user should
  insure that elements in the sequence are all of the same type."
